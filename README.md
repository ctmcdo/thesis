# thesis

This is my master's thesis. The title is 'Efficient Wireless Incremental Updates to Resource Constrained Devices' and it involves adapting [BSDiff](http://www.daemonology.net/bsdiff/) for reprogramming devices in IoT.

I was pretty happy with how it went (thanks very much Jonathan). Unfortunately, I didn't keep the fork of BSDiff, nor the modifications to NRF5's bootloader.
